## üìå Introduction

The Monty Hall Challenge is designed to engage users with the Monty Hall problem, a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. This project aims to educate users about probability and decision-making through an interactive web application. You can find the latest releases of the app [here](https://github.com/Yaman3535/Monty-Hall-Challenge/releases).

## üîç About the Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The setup is simple:

1. You are presented with three doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two doors are goats.
2. You choose one door.
3. The host, Monty Hall, who knows what is behind the doors, opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat.
4. You are then given the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the other unopened door.

The question is: What should you do to maximize your chances of winning the car? The counterintuitive answer is that you should always switch doors, as this gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car.
